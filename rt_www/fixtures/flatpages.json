At 12 he began year round USS competition with Rockville Montgomery Swim Club (RMSC). At 15 he made his first Junior Nationals qualifying times in the 50 and 100 free. He has always been, and always will be, a sprinter. Jeremy swam all four years in college at Yale University and started as a Red Tide swimmer in the fall of 2003. He began coaching for the team in 2004 and looks forward to another great season for Red Tide. Jeremy does not like doing open water swims but encourages and appreciates all others that do them.</p>\r\n<h3>Tyrone Hutchinson</h3>\r\n<p>Tyrone is a New York City native. He started to swim competitively at age seven at the local YMCA in the Bronx. At age twelve he joined the West Side Y Marlins.

He believes that technique and the nuances of swimming make a faster and smarter swimmer.</p>\r\n<h3>Brett Fisher</h3>\r\n<p>Brett Fisher joined Red Tide in March of 2006. As a sprint enthusiast he has been known to sprinkle a little fun into practice as long as it is associated with the word &quot;lactate.&quot; Brett's philosophy is to create &quot;smarter&quot; swimmers and believes that the best sets are not always the longest ones. Brett is currently working on a petition to get a 25-yard stroke and 50-yard IM event adopted into masters swimming. Why not 25's? Brett swam at Johns Hopkins University and enjoys staying active by playing soccer, boxing, and running.</p>\r\n<h3>Scott Werner</h3>\r\n<p>Scott Werner began swimming at the age of 4 in his hometown of Haymarket Virginia.&nbsp; As a member of the club team Solotar, Scott won several events at various Junior National Championships and competed in a number of Senior National Championships.

Currently, Coach Scott can be found training regularly with Red Tide as he intends to re-qualify for the 2008 Olympic Trials in Omaha Nebraska.&nbsp; Scott originally joined the coaching staff in the spring of 2007, after a little arm-twisting from the team President Kristin Gary.&nbsp; His early skepticism about joining Red Tide has been replaced with eternal gratitude because, as fate would have it, he really likes the people on the team.</p>\r\n<h3>Alan Fishman</h3>\r\n<p>Alan began his swimming career at the age of six and started swimming year-round at age nine. A graduate of JEB Stuart High School in Falls&nbsp; Church, VA, Alan was Captain, a school-record holder, and a Virginia High School State Champion.

Get your equipment ready. Take a shower. Don't get in the pool until a coach is on deck.</p>\r\n<h3>Team Work</h3>\r\n<p>While swimming might seem like a very individual activity, it actually requires a lot of collaboration. It is important that you are aware of your surround ings and work with others in the lane to make your workout run smoothly. During the beginning of the workout, take stock of your place in the lane. Assess your strengths  and weaknesses. Knowing this will make figuring out who is going to lead the lane an easier task. Maybe you will lead a kick set, but stay in back during the pull sets, o r vice versa. As you learn about yourself and your lane-mates, be sure to communicate with them, especially when there is a choice to swim a different stroke.</p>\r\n<h3>Know The Set</h3>\r\n<p>Workouts can be fast-paced affairs, not leaving much time for long explanations of each set. Be sure to listen carefully to the coach when he or she is giv ing the set. Everyone should understand the entire set before taking off.</p>\r\n<h3>Watch The Clock</h3>\r\n<p>Whether you are leading the lane or bringing up the rear, you should be responsible for keeping track of the number of laps you are swimming and the interv als you are leaving on. (Check out www.wsumastersswimming.org/workouts/paceclock.html for a great description and explanation of reading a pace clock.) If the set is part icularly long or complicated, you might want to make it a team effort and assign one person to count and another to watch the intervals. However, every swimmer sho uld be aware of where you are in the set and when you are coming in. If it is a sprint set, know what times you are &quot;holding&quot; or coming in on each time. If you have diffi culty seeing or reading the clock, you might want to try getting a wrist watch to synch with the pace clock.</p>\r\n<h3>Leave Five (Or Ten)</h3>\r\n<p>It is important to maintain an adequate distance between swimmers in the lane. If you leave less than five seconds behind the person in front of you, you w ill end up drafting off of them and probably catching up to them. This is frustrating for everyone. If there are only a few people in the lane, you might want to leave te n seconds to make it easier on everyone.</p>\r\n<h3>Respect Your Leader</h3>\r\n<p>The leader of a set is responsible for establishing the pace of the set. A good leader will pace the entire lane and won't &quot;blow it out&quot; on the first set a nd then die on the next ones. Remember that during challenging and longer distance sets, the leader of the lane will inevitably be working very hard. Even allowingfive se conds between swimmers, everyone is usually drafting off the leader. This will slow the leading swimmer down. If everyone is swimming at the same speed, trade off leading  the sets, rather than trying to pass the leader in the middle of a set.</p>\r\n<h3>Getting Lapped</h3>\r\n<p>During longer distance sets, lapping is often inevitable. This is when the leader of the lane catches up to and passes the last person in the lane. With ma ny people in the lane, you may be at a particular disadvantage at the head or rear of the lane when the first swimmer is leaving 30 or 40 seconds ahead of the last. Every one should be aware of where the others in the lane are.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>If you approach someone in front of you, tap their feet so they know that you are there. If you are in the middle of the lane, and feel strong and con fident, you can pass them. Do this quickly and carefully. Make sure you are not going to cause a head-on collision.</li>\r\n    <li>Try to avoid passing someone at the very end of the set, like on the last 25 of a 200. In that case, wait until you come to the wall and ask the perso n in front of you if you can go ahead of them.</li>\r\n    <li>If you get tapped in the middle of the lane, swim closer to the lane lines to allow the person to pass you. Slow down a little to let them pass,  this  isn't a race.</li>\r\n    <li>If you see someone coming up on you as you are turning (actually if you don't see the person behind you, it probably means they are very close), you might  want to think about pausing at the end of the next lap. In that case, pull to the right at the wall and allow the next swimmer to do a flip turn and proceed. Give them f ive seconds before taking off (or three if it's really crowded). Try to avoid inserting yourself immediately between two swimmers. This will just get everyone bunched up.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Don't take it personally. Everyone has their good days and bad days.</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Lane Spirit</h3>\r\n<p>While you may be swimming in a pool with 40+ people, your lane makes up its own little community. A lane that works well together will make the workout fee l good, even if it is challenging. Motivate your lane mates with a little positive feedback. Even a &quot;let's go&quot; can cheer you up in the middle of a discouraging set.</p>\r\n<div class=\"redline\" id=\"lingo\">\r\n<h2>Swimming Lingo</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">Every group establishes their own language and swimming is no exception, here are some terms that you might hear during a workout:</p>\r\n<h3>Warm-up</h3>\r\n<p>This is an essential part of the workout. A good warm up allows your muscles to loosen and warm up. Swim slowly at an easy pace. Your heart rate should not  be increased much during the first half of the warm up. A normal warm-up is about 1200 to 1500 yards. Wait until the coach gives the warm up to begin swimming.</p>\r\n<h3>Pulling</h3>\r\n<p>An exercise that uses just your arms. This usually involves putting a pull buoy or a kick board between your legs to suspend them.</p>\r\n<h3>Drill</h3>\r\n<p>A general term for doing technique specific work during a set. There are many different types of drills and often the coach will explain exactly what he or  she wants you to do. After swimming for a while, you will develop a repertoire of drills for each stroke that you may be called upon to use when an imprecise &quot;drill a 50 &quot; is offered.</p>\r\n<h3>Descend</h3>\r\n<p>For example, if you are told to do &quot;4 x 100 descend,&quot; you want to come in faster on each successive 100. Take the first one slowly and build your speed on  each 100. Look at the clock so you can tell how much you are &quot;descending&quot; or taking off each 100.</p>\r\n<h3>Build</h3>\r\n<p>To &quot;build a 50&quot; means to increase your speed over the course of the 50 yards so that you are sprinting into the finish.</p>\r\n<h3>Breakout</h3>\r\n<p>The first couple strokes after the push off. In breast-stroke, the break out is a strong kick and a stroke underwater. In the other strokes, it is 3-4 stro ng kicks under water and your first 2 strokes.</p>\r\n<h3>Pace Work</h3>\r\n<p>Keeping the same time and speed during a set. This usually implies going at a moderate speed in order to maintain the same time throughout a set.</p>\r\n<h3>Race Pace</h3>\r\n<p>Some sets are meant to replicate a meet, so you will be asked to go &quot;100 race pace for a 50.&quot; This means that you swim as fast as you would in a 100 yd rac e, but you only swim half that distance.</p>\r\n<h3>Main Set</h3>\r\n<p>As it sounds, this is the set that you have been warming up for. It is a chance to work hard.</p>\r\n<h3>Recovery</h3>\r\n<p>A recovery or &quot;easy&quot; set is often given between sets or after a hard set. This is also called &quot;active rest.&quot; Take it slow, use it to recover, and let your  heart rate return to normal.</p>\r\n<h3>Cool Down</h3>\r\n<p>This is the last part of the workout, but it is very important, especially if you have been sprinting or raising your heart rate. The cool down is a recove ry set that allows the lactic acid built up in your muscles to dissipate. Cooling down properly helps avoid muscle soreness.</p>", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 5, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"mimetype": "text/html", "registration_required": false, "title": "Triathlon Training With Red Tide", "url": "/tri/", "template_name": "flatpages/tri.html", "sites": [1], "content": "<h1>Red Tide Triathletes</h1>\r\n<div class=\"highlightbox\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"redline\">\r\n<h2>Try Red Tide for Tri Training</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">For many triathletes the swim is the toughest of the three events and training on one's own can be a real challenge! Most gyms, if they have  a pool, have a short one, maybe 20 yards (and shallow too). We swim in full, competition-length pools, either 25 yards or 25 meters. During the summer, we coordinate pool  time with other local master teams and sponsor workouts in an Olympic-distance 50 meter pool. A great experience for open water and tri competitions!</p>\r\n<p>Some triathletes feel that the swim is the least important of the events, especially as the races get longer (from Olympic to half to full Iron). Nothing c ould be further from the truth. Red Tide Masters swimming, from novice to experienced triathlete, will help you reach your goals. We focus on:</p>\r\n<h3>Camaraderie</h3>\r\n<p>Motivating you to get up and get out is tough. Make friends with others who can 'push' you.</p>\r\n<h3>Year Round Training</h3>\r\n<p>You can't bike outside during the winter, and at best, you need to run indoors on treadmills. We swim year round in top quality pools at colleges in NYC, r unning 10 scheduled workouts per week: mornings, evenings, and weekends.</p>\r\n<h3>Structured Workouts:</h3>\r\n<p>Improve your times and improve the quality of your swim workouts.</p>\r\n<p>Every workout is <em>structured</em>. Many Masters teams are more 'casual' in their approach. Red Tide has a proud history of carefully structuring every w orkout to make it matter. Every swim has:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>A warm up (swim, kick, drill)</li>\r\n    <li>Pre-set to increase readiness for the Main Set</li>\r\n    <li>Main-set (the core of any good workout), sometimes focusing on speed, strength or stamina, depending on the time of year. (Yes, we have a full year's  plan).</li>\r\n    <li>Finally, the Cool-down</li>\r\n    <li>Occasionally we do dry land work to build additional strength (calisthenics, etc.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Practicing strokes other than freestyle is indispensable for the triathlete. It balances muscle groups, increases flexibility, and reduces injury. We run r egular clinics to improve your freestyle as well as the other strokes (back, breast and fly). We'll help you improve your basics and get you moving!</p>\r\n<h3>NYC Triathlon Resources:</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Metro Tri</strong><br />\r\nThe NY Metropolitan Region's Multi-sport Resource<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.metrotri.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.metrotri.com</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Triathlon Association of New York</strong><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.tanyc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.tanyc.org</a></p>", "enable_comments": false}}]
